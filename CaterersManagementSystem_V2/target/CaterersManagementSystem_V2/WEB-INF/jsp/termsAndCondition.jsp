<u><h1 align="center">Balar Caterers Terms of Service:</h1></u><br><br>
<p>All customers of Balar’s catering services are subject to the terms and conditions contained in the below agreement. The below agreement is a legal contract between Balar and the service user (customer).</p>
<br><br> 

<h3>Terms of Quotation: </h3><br><br>
<p>The price for services shall be the price stated on the quotation or invoice. The quotation is valid only for one week only from the date of transmittal of the quotation to client. Kindly contact our office for an extension of date. Balar reserves the right to reject any such offer. We reserves the right to reject your proposal and not sending the quotation for your requirement, it depends on availability of event date, number of guest and event location. The company reserves the right to revise catering quotes on changes to event. Any type of changes, additions or modifications in menu or number of guest, etc. must do at least 3 working days prior to event date.</p>
<br><br> 

<h3>Booking Confirmation:</h3><br><br>
<p>The client’s confirmation means the client has accepted these terms and conditions and the quotation. Once the clients deposit has been received a receipt will be issued by Balar catering together with a formal confirmation invoice which will include your draft menu, event summary and estimated costs based on the number of guests and selections made by the client at this time.</p>
<br><br>

<h3>Payments Terms:</h3><br><br> 
<p>
A payment of 50% deposit is required at the time of booking or one week before the day of the event whichever is earlier. Remaining balance a payment of 40% due must be paid one day prior to the day of the event unless other arrangements are approved in advance with management. Remaining 10% balance paid after event completion. 
1) Cost: due to the fluctuating cost of food items, menu prices are subject to change when a drastic change in the menu ingredient cost occurs, client has two options. 
a) Client will pay the additional cost based on the current adjusted price, or 
b) Substitute other menu items to maintain the agreed upon per person/platter menu.
2) Payment method: all prices quoted are based on cash payments only. No personal and cashable cheques are accepted. However cheque payments are subject to accept, but due to bank clerical clearance all cheques are accepted seven 7 working days before the event date.
</p><br><br> 

<h3></>Menu to Be Served:</h3><br><br> 
<p>Caterer reserve right to make small changes to the menu only if ingredients are unable to be source due to reasons beyond the control of parties</p>
<br><br> 

<h3>Guest Count:</h3><br><br> 
<p>Our catering depends on the fact that any event we undertake is separately planned, purchased and cooked. This does mean, however, that we have to have very strict terms regarding numbers.
A) All prices are quoted for a specific number of guests. When numbers drop, our overheads do not reduce proportionally and therefore our menu prices increase.
B) We require confirmation of numbers to be catered if increase the guest list before three days of an event. After this date, increase in numbers of up to 10 to 20 people can usually be accommodated but no allowances can be made if numbers drop.
C) If the number of guests attending exceeds the numbers booked (and we are able to cater for them) we will charge for the greater number.
D) If the number of guests attending is less than the number booked we will still charge the total number ordered you placed.
</p><br><br> 

<h3>Additional Services:</h3><br><br> 
<p>Client agrees to pay any for any and all additional services requested by the client not included in contract. Any additional service requested shall be made by the client in writing.</p>  
<br><br> 
<h3>Force Majeure:</h3><br><br> 
<p>Caterers shall not be any liable for losses resulting from nonfulfillment of any terms of provisions of event contract, if caterer shall be prevented or delayed from performing in whole or in part because of riots, strikes, and flood or by any other act occurrence not within the reasonable control of caterer, which it could not prevented</p>
<br><br> 

<h3>Change of Event Date or Venue:</h3><br><br> 

<p>Caterer will apply the entire balance of client’s deposits and prepayments, towards another event, subject to caterer’s availability. All costs are subject to change.</p>
<br><br> 


<h3>Storage:</h3><br><br> 
<p>Prior approval from caterer is required for any storage service before or after the event/function.</p>

<h3>Prices:</h3><br><br> 

<p>Prices stated are subject to change according to the market price of products and with final guaranteed number of guests. Caterer will inform client of market price changes no later than 30 days prior to the event. Client will have the option of revising products and service to reduce costs prior to payment as described in payment term. Upon payment the final price is fixed and may only change due to a change in number of guests or mutually agreed upon changes in the services and/or menu provided</p>
<br><br> 

<h3>Rentals:</h3><br><br> 
<p>Caterer may provide all or part the rental items for the event. However, certain items may incur restocking & cancellation fees. If caterer arranges rentals, for the client, through a rental company, client will have to pay the rental company directly/through us. Any loss or damage to any rentals will be billed to client after the event.</p>
<br><br> 

<h3>Cancellation:</h3><br><br> 
<p>If the client needs to cancel the event with any reason like client / venue / acts of god, client must provide written notice to caterer. Client understands that upon entering into the contract, caterer is committing time and resources to this event and thus cancellation would result in lost income and lost business opportunities in an amount hard to precisely calculate. Therefore, the following cancellation limitations will apply. If client requests cancellation of the contract will be charge it completely depend on the caterer’s accordance to days remaining to the event. If client cancellation evet before 3 days in advance of the event date, caterer shall be entitled to 100 percent of the estimated total cost. The client’s deposit will be credited against the cancellation fees owed. Any balance will be payable upon the notice of cancellation.</p>
<br><br> 

<h3>Food Policy:</h3><br><br> 
<p>A) Quantity: caterer will prepare between five -ten percent overage based on the final number of guest count registered by client. Part of this overage is to include food for the staff and/or service providers. Client will not be charged for this.
B) Leftovers: it is not our policy to leave leftover food as it is never the same the following day. If, however, you wish to keep the food you must ask the event manager –in-charge on the site. They will then transfer any left overs to your own dishes once the service staff have been fed. Balar reserves the right to discard any leftover food. If you (client) or any of your guests request to take any of the remaining uneaten food items it means we are not responsible for any harm 
C) We accept no liability for any food supplied to the client by another caterer (or food products suppliers by the client themselves) in additional to those arranged by Balar caterers.
D) Dietary requirements and allergies: Balar will try hard to provide suitable adaptions to the clients menu for any guests with special dietary requirements or allergies. We cannot however take responsibility for any guests unless advised in advance.
E) Alcoholic beverages: Balar caterers will never supply any form of alcoholic beverages for any kind of event.
